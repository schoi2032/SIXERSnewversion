      <h2 class="section-title"><i class="fa-solid fa-sack"></i>> Lunar New Year in Korea</h2>
      <p>Lunar New Year is one of the most important traditional holidays in many Asian countries.
        It marks the start of the new year according to the lunar calendar, which is based on the moon's cycles.
        Because of this, the date changes every year, usually falling between late January and mid-February. 
        Lunar New Year represents new beginnings, renewal, and hope for good fortune. It is a time when families reunite,
        honor their ancestors, and reflect on the past year while welcoming the next one with positive wishes. 
        In South Korea, Lunar New Year is known as Seollal, and it is considered one of the country’s biggest holidays.
        Celebrations typically last three days, though travel and family gatherings can extend the holiday period. 
        Many people return to their hometowns to spend time with relatives, making it one of the busiest travel seasons
        of the year. A central tradition during Seollal is charye, an ancestral memorial ritual. Families prepare a table
        of traditional foods and perform respectful bows to honor their ancestors and ask for blessings. 
        Another important custom is sebae, where younger family members bow deeply to their elders as a sign of respect.
        In return, elders offer words of wisdom, good-luck wishes, and sometimes money called sebaetdon. 
        Food is especially meaningful during Seollal, with tteokguk, a soup made with sliced rice cakes, being the most 
        symbolic dish. Eating tteokguk represents becoming a year older and starting fresh. People often wear traditional
        clothing called hanbok and enjoy folk games such as yutnori. Overall, Seollal emphasizes family bonds, respect for 
        elders, and preserving cultural traditions.
