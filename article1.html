      <p>Biking to school is about to get easier. By September 30, Chadwick International will install 125 new bike racks in shaded areas around campus. New bike racks are being added to provide both convenience and protection from the sun. The Middle and Upper School will benefit the most, gaining 68 additional parking spots and bringing the total to 262 spaces for student bicycles. With this expansion, more students will be able to bike to school without worrying about overcrowded racks or limited availability.

Students are reminded to park only in the designated areas and to avoid blocking fire lanes, as safety remains a top priority on campus. The new racks have been strategically placed to make bike parking more organized and accessible for everyone.

According to Mr. Fagogenis, our assistant head of school, these changes are an important step toward encouraging sustainable transportation. He believes the new racks will not only make biking to Chadwick easier and more efficient, but also create a safer and more welcoming environment for the entire community.</p>
