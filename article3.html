      <p>Chadwick’s Got Talent is a student council–led initiative that provides students and faculty with a welcoming platform to voluntarily
        express their talents in front of the entire Middle School community. More than just a showcase, the event celebrates creativity, courage,
        and individuality, encouraging participants to step outside their comfort zones and share what makes them unique. The judges, known for
        their appreciative yet humorous personalities, played a key role in boosting students’ confidence. Through lighthearted commentary, they
        helped create a positive atmosphere where performers felt encouraged rather than judged. The event highlighted CI’s values of belonging
        and care, reminding everyone that talent comes in many forms. From energetic K-pop dance performances and soulful singing to impressive
        juggling acts, the audience witnessed a wide range of abilities and passions. Each performance was met with enthusiastic applause, reinforcing
        a sense of mutual respect and celebration. Chadwick’s Got Talent was not only entertaining but also meaningful. 
        It strengthened connections across grade levels, allowed students to appreciate one another’s strengths, and fostered a stronger sense of community.
        By giving everyone a chance to shine, the event truly embodied the spirit of a supportive and inclusive school environment.
