        <p class="interview-meta">By: Shane Choi • 12/03/2025</p>
        <div class="interview-content">
          <p><strong>What is your favorite subject and why?</strong></p>
          <p>My favorite subject is Math and Science because both my teachers are really nice, the class and things we do is fun and I really enjoy and feel happy and included when I have those classes.</p>

          <p><strong>What is your favorite memory from this year so far?</strong></p>
          <p>My favorite memory is when we had boom, because we were new to the community and the system, and we were able to meet together and enjoy the wave park and have fun with each other.
</p>

          <p><strong>What do you like most about the Sixers community?</strong></p>
          <p>I like that everyone is nice, people are very engaging, and we have a strong relationship and that we fit in together nicely.</p>
