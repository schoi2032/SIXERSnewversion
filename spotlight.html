        <h3 class="student-name"> Edward Lee</h3>
        <p class="student-grade">Grade 6 Student</p>
        <div class="student-info">
          <p><strong>Favorite Subject:</strong> PHE, Sports</p>
          <p><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Boxing, Basketball</p>
          <p><strong>Dream Job:</strong> Basketball or Boxing Athlete</p>
          <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Edward usually plays basketball, but he is better at boxing!</br><br></p>
        </div>

        <p class="student-description">Edward recently made his mark at the 1st Yongsan District Boxing Tournament,
          where he fought his way to the finals and came out on top. Representing Grade 6, he showed incredible focus,
          strength, and determination in every round.
          His victory wasn't just about winning a title- it was about proving his hard work and dedication in the ring.
          Edward's triumph in the tournament stands as a powerful start to what looks like a promising boxing journey
          ahead. </p>

        <p class="student-grade">Grade 6 Student</p>

        <div class="student-info">
          <p><strong>Favorite Sport:</strong> N/A, Prefers Music</p>
          <p><strong>Talents:</strong> Playing the Cello</p>
          <p><strong>Family:</strong> DJ is an only child!</p>
          <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "There is no perfect. Perfection is something to strive for but can't be
            achieved."</br><br></p>
        </div>

        <p class="student-description">Daniel's trip to Hungary was all about the cello. He went there to compete,
          putting everything he's practiced into those few powerful performances. It wasn't easy-there were nerves, long
          rehearsals, and tough competition-but his passion carried him through. In the end, he earned a certificate for
          his performance, a proud reminder of how far he's come. More than the award, it was the experience itself that
          stuck with him-the music, the people, and the feeling of doing what he loves on a big stage.</p>
